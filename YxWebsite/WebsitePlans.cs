/*

What I Did:
- Added migration and update database.
- Changed db connection string path
- Changed Naming of Models.
- Coded add service method for LC. 
- Changed all MyPersonalWebsite namespaces to YxWebsite.
- Debugged and fixed web app not running error.
- Successfully added LC upload to database.

Excited Achievements:
- Successfully work out the image storing & displaying algorithm. (and the supporting css for framing too)
- 

Website Plans:
- Continue set up the image upload dialog for lc, currently setting up the flow and image conversion of the drop zone.
- Add audit trails model and create audit trail straight from service.
- Set border size based on LC image in LcDialog. Later on should be uploading images in 16:9.
- Add a login function so that if it is me that has logged in, I can utilize the add post delete post etc function.
- Resize image of Lc upload properly. (https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-auto-resize-an-image-to-fit-an-html-container.html)
 

Special Notes:
- The dialogs of Radzen look better. Use Radzen for dialogs. 
- New and edit pages/dialog should reuse the same component/code to reduce duplicated code.
- 
 
Thoughts:
- Ahh, my laptop is no longer using the same "pc name", so the default computer path has to be changed as well
