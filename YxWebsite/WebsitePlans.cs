Website Plans:
- Continue set up the image upload dialog for lc, currently setting up the flow and image conversion of the drop zone.
- Add a login function so that if it is me that has logged in, I can utilize the add post delete post etc function.
- Resize image of Lc upload properly. (https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-auto-resize-an-image-to-fit-an-html-container.html)
 

Special Notes:
- The dialogs of Radzen look better. Use Radzen for dialogs. 
- New and edit pages/dialog should reuse the same component/code to reduce duplicated code.
