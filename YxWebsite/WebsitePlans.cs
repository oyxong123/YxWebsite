What I Did:
- Add isInitialized variable to check if all data is loaded before page displays data. 
- Write GetLcRecordById method in LC service.

Excited Achievements:
- Successfully work out the image storing & displaying algorithm. (and the supporting css for framing too)
- Woo!! @o@ I'm starting to experiment with custom css class dyy.
- 

Website Plans:
- Adjust lc record mudcards.
- Make app bar become Elevation="1" when a dialog is open, other times just make it Elevation="0".
- Save the state of previously expanded drawer after clicking into any link (Or can just highlight the current page link when open the menu) (NavMenu).
- Contract other nav groups when a new nav group is opened. (NavMenu)
- Add audit trails model and create audit trail straight from service.
- Set border size based on LC image in LcDialog. Later on should be uploading images in 16:9.
- Add a login function so that if it is me that has logged in, I can utilize the add post delete post etc function.
- Resize image of Lc upload properly. (https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-auto-resize-an-image-to-fit-an-html-container.html)
 

Special Notes:
- The dialogs of Radzen look better. Use Radzen for dialogs. 
- New and edit pages/dialog should reuse the same component/code to reduce duplicated code.
